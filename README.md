## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage user sessions with token-based authentication.
- **Article Management**: Fetch, search, and view articles with pagination.
- **Personalized News Feed**: Retrieve news tailored to user preferences.
- **Integration**: Fetch news from NewsAPI and the New York Times API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.3+
- Laravel 11
- Composer
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install

3. Set up the environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate

4. Configure your database settings in the .env file.

5. Run migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate

6. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve

## Environment Configuration

To ensure that the application can fetch news from the APIs, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- **NYT_API_KEY**: Your API key for accessing the New York Times API.
- **NEWS_API_KEY**: Your API key for accessing the News API.

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Obtain API Keys:**
   - Sign up for an API key from the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

2. **Update the `.env` File:**
   - Open the `.env` file located in the root of your project.
   - Add the following lines with your respective API keys:

     ```plaintext
     NYT_API_KEY=your_nyt_api_key_here
     NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Save and Close the `.env` File.**

4. **Clear Configuration Cache (if applicable):**
   - Run the following Artisan command to clear and cache your configuration:

     ```bash
     php artisan config:cache
     ```

By setting these environment variables, the application will be able to use the API keys for fetching and updating news data.

## Testing

For running tests, you should configure a separate environment. Laravel uses the `.env.testing` file for this purpose.

### Steps to Set Up Testing Environment

1. **Create `.env.testing` File:**
   - Copy your `.env` file to a new file named `.env.testing`:

     ```bash
     cp .env .env.testing
     ```

2. **Update `.env.testing`:**
   - Open the `.env.testing` file and set the `APP_ENV` to `testing` and configure any testing-specific settings if needed:

     ```plaintext
     APP_ENV=testing
     DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
     DB_DATABASE=:memory:
     ```

     Adjust the database settings as required for testing. The example above uses an in-memory SQLite database for faster tests.

3. **Run Tests:**
   - You can run your tests using PHPUnit:

     ```bash
     php artisan test
     ```

# Project Setup with Docker

This project can be set up using Docker and Docker Compose. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed. [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>

2. **Start Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d

    This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in the background.

3. **Run Migrations**:
    Execute migrations inside the Docker container:

   ```bash
    docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

    Replace app with the name of your application service as defined in the docker-compose.yml file. This command will run the database migrations to set up the database schema.

4. **Access the Application**:

    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` or a different port specified in your `docker-compose.yml`.
